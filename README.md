## ‚≠ê What is Gaze? ‚≠ê

Gaze provides a TUI that lets you quickly search through your Kubernetes cluster for keywords in application logs.

## Features

- Search Kubernetes pod logs for a comprehensive list of error-related keywords.
- Interactive selection of pods to inspect logs in detail.
- Highlighting of keywords within the log output for easy identification.

## Installation

### Homebrew üç∫

To install gaze using Homebrew, you can run the following commands:

```sh
brew tap deggja/gaze https://github.com/deggja/gaze
brew install gaze
```

### Build from source üíª
```
git clone https://github.com/deggja/gaze.git --depth 1
cd gaze
go build -o gaze
```

## Usage

### Starting the app

To start the game, simply run the compiled binary:

```sh
./gaze
```

## Kubernetes interaction

Gaze will require access to your Kubernetes cluster. Ensure your `kubeconfig` is set up correctly before starting the game. The application currently expects the kubeconfig at its default location.
